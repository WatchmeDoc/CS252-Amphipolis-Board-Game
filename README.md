The game mostly does not allow the user to make any mistakes. It disables and enables
the available buttons properly. I also included .idea created by Intellij

# RULES:
> You can only pick a tile after pressing the "Draw Tiles" button, and only enough tiles
allowed by the game rules.

> You may only use 1 Character card each round, and only after picking your tiles.

> You can only use "End Turn" button after picking all the tiles required by the rules (2 or less from the same sorting area)

> You may only save the game after clicking on "End Turn" button.

> You cannot enter any player with empty name, or with the secret name.



# RUN_SPECIFICATIONS:

>> You only have to run main for the game to start, but all in all you just want someone
to create an instance of the controller. Should this happen, the game will start properly
and everything will be set. I included a default main function for testing purposes.

>> Please DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE MAKE ANY NAME CHANGES to the folder 
"images_2020" as the file names are used pretty much everywhere. You may add a different image
under the same name though for custom textures :))

>> GUI is properly adjusted to work on any monitor resolution - every component is dynamically placed
based on that, althgough I haven't had the chance to test it out on different resolutions other than 1920x1080p yet.

# NOTE:
>> Remember to add jar file from .idea > artifacts > json-simple-1.1.1.jar to your IDE before compiling.

Enjoy the game :)
