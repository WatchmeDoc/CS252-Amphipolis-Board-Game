The game basically does not allow the user to make any mistakes. It disables and enables
the available buttons properly.

More specifically:
>> You can only pick a tile after pressing the "Draw Tiles" button, and only enough tiles
allowed by the game rules.
>> You may only use 1 Character card each round, and only after picking your tiles.
>> You can only use "End Turn" button after picking all the tiles required.
>> You may only save the game after clicking on "End Turn" button.
>> You cannot enter any player with empty name, or with "The Secret Name".

Run specifications:
>> You only have to run main for the game to start, but all in all you just want someone
to create an instance of the controller. Should this happen, the game will start properly
and everything will be set. I included a default main function for testing purposes.
>> Please DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE MAKE ANY NAME CHANGES to the folder 
"images_2020" as the file names are used pretty much everywhere. You may add a different image
under the same name though for custom textures :))
>> Do not forget to include from .idea > artifacts > json-simple-1.1.1.jar file

Enjoy the game :)
